This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(tidyplate)
```

Read in a layout file, which by default, will print a summary of the plate contents. 
```{r}
LAYOUT <- "dose_response_layout.xlsx"
layout <- read_layout(LAYOUT, plate_notes = "adding my own custom plate note here") 
```

Or you can print a summary of it's contents at any other time using summarise_plate()
```{r}
summarise_plate(layout)
```

You can plot the plate layouts 
```{r}
plate_plot <- plateview_plot(layout, show_empty_wells = TRUE, "compound_conc_uM")
plate_plot #+ theme(legend.position = "none")
```

Layouts are most helpful when combined with the data associated with each well
```{r}
labeled <- data |> 
  left_join(layout, by = "well")

```

Because it provides a streamlined and tidy way of plotting/analyzing data
```{r}

```


You can create a new layout file by passing the experimetnal variables to be considered to make_layout_template()
```{r}
make_layout_template(variables = , 
                     plate_type = ,
                     path = , 
                     ...)
```


are standard ggplots, 
Once the layout is read in, you can add custom annotations to specific wells, or the entire plate.
```{r}
# either a single annotation
layout <- annotate_plate(layout, annotation = "something important to remember about this plate")

# or multiple annotations at the same time
layout <- annotate_plate(layout, annotation = c("a note", "another note", "a third note")) 

# to a single well
layout <- annotate_well(well = "A1", annotation = "something weird happened in this well")

# or multiple wells
layout <- annotate_well(well = c("A1", "A2", "B1", "B2"), annotation = "remember something about these wells")
```
