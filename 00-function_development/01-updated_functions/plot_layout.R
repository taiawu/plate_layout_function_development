#' Make a Plate-view plot
#'
#' Makes a plot that mimics looking down at a well plate. Wells are colored based on a user-defined column from a layout.
#'
#' @param plate_data a layout tibble (as created by dsfworld::read_plate_layout()), containing columns for plate row (called "row"), plate column (called "column"), and one variable by which the plate will be colored
#' @param fill_col the column in the input layout by which to color in the wells in the plot
#' @param title_var the column for which the plot will be named. Shuldn't be an argument in the future; I struggled with tidyeval here so just put it at as different variable... Gets sent to glue::glue(). See make_all_plots function for the origin of this issue, with !!sym(x) working for the fill_col argument, but un-passable to glue.
#' @param shape the shape of the points used to make the wells. Defaults to 22 (filled square).
#' @param size the shape of the points used to make the wells. Defaults to 4.
#' @param title_prefix a prefix to be added to the title. Functionally, this can remain the same while title_var changes, to create consistent names when mapping over many variables. Also hopefully only a temporary argument, to be fixed in later versions.
#' @param ... to be passed to the ggplot2 aesetheics inside this function. Not actually used inside the function yet... another place to improve things here in the near furture.
#'
#' @return a plate-view plot, with wells colored based on the information on that well in the user-defined variable given in .fill_var.

#' Add empty wells to a partially-filled layout
