This notebook compiles the existing functions and tests for reading input layouts outside of the context of RShiny applications.

I have written drafts of RShiny application modules, but those are not relevant here. 

As of now, the main source of these functions is the dsfworld package. 

Copy-pasting those functions here...

```{r}
